title: Track Svelte Components
---

Sentry's Svelte SDK offers a feature to monitor the performance of your Svelte components: **Component Tracking**. By enabling this feature, you will get spans in your transactions showing the initialization and update cycles of your Svelte components. This feature allows you to get a drilled down view into how your components are behaving, to e.g. identify slow component initializations or frequent component updates which might have an impact on your app's performance.

## Usage

To get started, simply add the Sentry `componentTrackingPreprocessor` to your `svelte.config.js` file:

```javascript {tabTitle: svelte.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

const config = {
  preprocess: [
    Sentry.componentTrackingPreprocessor({
      // Add the components you want to be tracked to this array.
      // Specificy `true` to track all components or `false` to disable
      // tracking entirely
      // (defaults to `true`)
      trackComponents: ["Navbar", "PrimaryButton", "LoginForm"],
      // To disable component initialization spans, set this to `false`.
      // (defaults to `true`)
      trackInit: true,
      // To disable component update spans, set this to `false`
      // (defaults to `true`)
      trackUpdates: false,
    }),
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
};

export default config;
```

This preprocessor is called at application build time. It inserts a function call to a function in the Sentry SDK into the `<script>` tag of your components before this component is compiled by the Svelte compiler. The called function takes care of recording the spans by leveraging the Svelte component's lifecycle hooks.

## Alternative Usage

If you don't want to use our preprocessor to automatically insert the function call to track all components, you can call the tracking function manually in every component you would like to see tracked yourself:

```javascript {tabTitle: MyComponent.svelte}
<script>
  import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";
  Sentry.trackComponent({
    // To disable component initialization spans, set this to `false`.
    // (defaults to `true`)
    trackInit: true,
    // To disable component update spans, set this to `false`
    // (defaults to `true`)
    trackUpdates: false,
    // Specify a custom name to be shown in the span description
    // (defaults to the automatically detected component name)
    componentName: string})
  // rest of your code
</script>
```
